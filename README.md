<h3>LinkedIn Recommendations</h3>
<p>I am honored to have received feedback from my mentors at Anko. Here are some kind words from the people who worked closely with me:</p>

<h4>Gaurav S M (Lead Data Scientist at Anko):</h4>
<p><em>"I worked with Surya closely for almost a year. In his first project, he demonstrated his ability to quickly grasp data science concepts and work with complex data systems. His ability to analyze data, develop models, and extract valuable insights greatly contributed to the success of our team. His willingness to learn and his strong communication skills set him apart."</em></p>

<h4>Roselin George (Head of Data Science at Anko):</h4>
<p><em>"I hired Surya as an intern straight out of college. From the first day, I knew there was a spark in him. He was extremely professional, a quick learner, and had a keen sense of urgency to succeed. Surya went above and beyond my expectations during his internship and was made a permanent member of my team. His ability to work independently on a complex project was remarkable. He excelled at problem-solving and was proficient in a wide array of tools like SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI."</em></p>
